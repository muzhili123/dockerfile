# Format: node/port:type:expire:speed
# Node: numeric ID for mosix, host/ip for ssh/rsh, anything for local. Append /<port> to specify port.
# Type: ssh, mosix, rsh, local
# Expire: date in seconds + epoch that lease expires, leave blank for forever. Used by moscd.
# Speed: nodes speed in key/sec. Set to 1 or more, see README
